				<p class="description">
					I am Apara. I am a Computer Science student studying at University of Colorado, Boulder. But, I really prefer to be called an experimental investigator.
					What that means is that I find nearly everything interesting, and I look at them from the perspective of how computers can help undertand and nurture it.
					One day, I want it to be possible to be able to predict events and anamolies in our world just by observing and collecting data that are seemingly irrelevant.
					A good example of this would be predicting cancer at a very early stage, or identify genetic defects even before the child is born.<br><br>
					With that said, I am naturally inclined to fields of Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Artificial Intelligence. I believe that with these tools it would be possible to achieve my dream.<br><br>
					Apart from that, I spend time playing my guitar and reading fiction (from where most of my inspiration stems). Although not a hard core gamer, I enjoy playing a good video game once in a while.<br><br>
					On my website, you can find more specific projects I have been a part of, and my contact information. So, feel free to look around and shoot me an email if any of my works interests you!

			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p>Here is a list of projects I am/have been a part of:</p>
			<div class="container">
				<h3>Ruins Escapade</h3>
				<h5>Oct 2016 - Present</h5>
				<div class="wrapper">
					<p class="description">
						This is a simple dungeon crawler game that I made for my Intro to Computing project. This game is written in C++ using SDL Libraries.<br>
						Ruins Escapade is a straightforward game where the player controls the hero who is trying to find his way back home through a labryinth<br>
						I made this game over 10 days and it currently has only one level. I am hoping to add more levels soon. If you are interested in working on the game with me, feel free to contact me.

				<h3>Project Euler</h3>
				<h5>Sept 2016 - Present</h5>
				<div class="wrapper">
					<p class="description">
						I recently came across this amazing site with lots of computing problems - <a href="https://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a><br>
						Since I've always been a fan of math, I began solving these mathematics problems that not only require high computing power but efficient strategies.<br>
						I primarily code my solutions in C++ because it is a powerful and versatile language.

				<h3>Robotics</h3>
				<h5>Nov 2015 - June 2016</h5>
				<div class="wrapper">
					<p class="description">
						When I was in India, I started playing around with Arduino and robots. My team, consisting of 5 members, built robots as a hobby.
						We built everything from simple wired Soccer playing robots to autonomous maze following robots to an Underwater ROV.
						Since I moved to USA, I have not been able to work with them and my focus shifted to other interesting fields.

				<h3>High School Projects</h3>
				<p>This is a short list of some interesting projects I did while in high school. They cover various fields in science such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology</p>
				<div class="wrapper">
					<h4>Study of Ionospheric Models in improving Accuracy of GPS</h4>
					<h5>Jan 2015 - May 2015</h5>
					<h5>Electronics and Commuincation</h5>
					<div class="wrapper">
						<p class="description">In this research project, I studied the Klobuchar Ionospheric Model that is used to correct GPS signals for accuracy, which would otherwise be highly erroneous</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="wrapper">
					<h4>Removal of Consumed Alcohol from Human Body</h4>
					<h5>March 2015 - May 2015</h5>
					<h5>Chemistry</h5>
					<div class="wrapper">
						<p class="description">
							We all know that the organic reaction between an alcohol and a carbonic acid yields an ester, which is widely found in fruits.<br>
							In this project, I studied how feasible it would be to convert alcohol (ethanol) into harmless ester by reacting it with acetic acid (vinegar) and whether it would be possible to replicate this reaction inside the human body

					<h4>Effect of Magnetism on Growth of Plants</h4>
					<h5>Aug 2013 - Nov 2013</h5>
					<h5>Biology / Physics</h5>
					<div class="wrapper">
						<p class="description">In this project, I germinated seeds in the presence of a magnetic field and compared its growth to a control group.</p>
