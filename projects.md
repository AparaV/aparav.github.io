Here is a list of projects I am/have been a part of:

## Course Planner
#### Jan 2017 - Present
An application that helps you choose courses in a correct sequence to avoid missing pre-requisite courses.
This project is written in JavaScript using React.js and Node.js. <br>
Planning future semesters can be daunting when you have a lot of options.
But there is a very simple logic that dictates this process, and it does not work well when done manually.
This is why I decided to teach the computer the same process.
Now, all you need to do is enter the courses you wish to take and the pre-requisites for each of them and let the computer take care of the rest for you.

## Popularity on Twitter
#### Nov 2016 - Dec 2016
This program calculates how popular a phrase is on Twitter.
This is written in Python. <br>
It collects all tweets containing the track word for 5 minutes and calculates a score based on who tweeted them and how many times it has been liked. <br>
The formula for the popularity score is a bit wibbly wobbly and still needs some work. So, it will not give you an absolutely deterministic score. <br>
This program can also analyze a user profile to see what they most commonly tweet about and how frequently they tweet.

## Ruins Escapade
#### Oct 2016
This is a simple dungeon crawler game that I made for my Intro to Computing project. This game is written in C++ using SDL Libraries. <Br>
Ruins Escapade is a straightforward game where the player controls the hero who is trying to find his way back home through a labyrinth. <br>
I made this game in less than a week and it currently has only one level.
I am hoping to add more levels when I get the time.

## Project Euler
#### Sept 2016 - Present
I recently came across this amazing site with lots of computing problems: [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net/). <br>
Since I've always been a fan of math, I began solving these mathematics problems that not only require high computing power but efficient strategies. <br>
I primarily code my solutions in C++ because it is a powerful and versatile language. But you might find a bit of Python in there.

## Robotics
#### Nov 2015 - June 2016
When I was in India, I started playing around with Arduino and robots.
My team, consisting of 5 members, built robots as a hobby.
We built everything from simple wired Soccer playing robots to autonomous maze following robots to an Underwater ROV.
Since I moved to USA, I have not been able to work with them and my focus shifted to other interesting fields.

## High School Projects
This is a short list of some interesting projects I did while in high school.
They cover various fields in science such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology:

### Study of Ionospheric Models in improving Accuracy of GPS
##### Jan 2015 - May 2015
*Electronics and Communication* <br>
In this research project, I studied the Klobuchar Ionospheric Model that is used to correct GPS signals for accuracy, which would otherwise be highly erroneous.

### Removal of Consumed Alcohol from Human Body
##### March 2015 - May 2015
*Chemistry* <br>
The organic reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid yields an ester, which is widely found in fruits.
In this project, I studied how feasible it would be to convert alcohol (ethanol) into harmless ester by reacting it with acetic acid (vinegar) and whether it would be possible to replicate this reaction inside the human body.

### Effect of Magnetism on Growth of Plants
##### Aug 2013 - Nov 2013
*Biology / Physics* <br>
In this project, I germinated seeds in the presence of a magnetic field and compared its growth to a control group.
I found that plants in a magnetic field responded better to environmental factors and nutrients.
They grew faster and the green shade in the leaves was brighter.
However, when they were not watered consistently, the control group maintained its health while the study group's leaves turned yellow quickly.
