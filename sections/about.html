      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="description">
        I am Apara. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at University of Colorado, Boulder. But, I really prefer to be called an experimental investigator.
        What that means is that I find nearly everything interesting, and I look at them from the perspective of how computers can help undertand and nurture it.
        One day, I want it to be possible to be able to predict events and anamolies in our world just by collecting and analyzing data that are seemingly irrelevant.
        A good example of this would be predicting cancer at a very early stage, or identifying genetic defects even before the child is born.<br><br>
        With that said, I am naturally inclined to fields of Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Artificial Intelligence. I believe that with these tools it would be possible to achieve my dream.<br><br>
        Apart from that, I spend time playing my guitar and reading fiction (from where most of my inspiration stems).
        Although not a hard core gamer, I enjoy playing a good video game once in a while. Albeit not-so-great at it, I play DOTA 2 frequently.<br><br>
