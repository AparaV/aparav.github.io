title: About

I am Apara (abridged version of Aparajithan Venkateswaran). I'm an undergraduate student at **University of Colorado, Boulder** studying **Computer Science** and **Applied Mathematics**.

I am primarily inclined to **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** (there is a subtle [distinction](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/)).
But on the whole, I'm really interested in how these complex ideas can be used to solve problems, simplify everyday tasks, and create *magic*.

Apart from that, I spend time playing my guitar and reading fiction (from where most of my inspiration stems).
I enjoy playing a good video game once in a while. And I play Chess frequently.
