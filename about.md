title: About

I am Apara. I'm an undergraduate **Computer Science** student, *double majoring* with **Applied Mathematics** at **University of Colorado, Boulder**.
But, I really prefer to be called an *experimental investigator* (yes, I stole that title from *The Invisible Man*).

It is my dream that one day, I want it to be possible to be able to scientifically and reasonably predict events and anomalies in our world just by collecting and analyzing data that are seemingly irrelevant.
A good example of this would be predicting cancer at a very early stage, or identifying genetic defects even before the child is born.

With that said, I am naturally inclined to fields of **Machine Learning**, **Computational Neuroscience**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.
I believe that with these tools (there is a subtle [distinction](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/)) it would be possible to achieve my dream.

Apart from that, I spend time playing my guitar and reading fiction (from where most of my inspiration stems).
Although not a hard core gamer, I enjoy playing a good video game once in a while. And albeit not-so-great at it, I play Chess frequently.
