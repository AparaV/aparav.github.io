In the [previous article]({% post_url 2017-07-31-regression-on-housing-data %}), we used linear regression to predict the price of houses.
Then, we saw that this model does not find any non-linear correlations.
The most fascinating thing about neural networks is that they automatically model
any non-linearities present in the phenomenon.
In this article, we will use neural networks to overcome that shortcoming.

Note that this is a follow-up post. We already downloaded, and cleaned the [Ames housing dataset](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf){:target="blank"}
in the [previous article]({% post_url 2017-07-31-regression-on-housing-data %}).
If you haven't done that already, you should probably go ahead and finish that first.
In addition to that, we also split the dataset into 3 parts (training, validation, and testing).
I will jump into the code assuming that's already done.
Or if you prefer, you can follow along by running the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AparaV/kaggle-competitions/blob/master/getting-started-house-prices/house_price_predictor.ipynb).

**All of the code used here is available in the form of a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AparaV/kaggle-competitions/blob/master/getting-started-house-prices/house_price_predictor.ipynb){:target="blank"} which you can run on your machine.**
