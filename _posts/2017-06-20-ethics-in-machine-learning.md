Will this *sentience* take over humanity? Or will it help us reach a Utopian era? It's definitely not a binary question. But, one of the less commonly asked questions (and perhaps rightly so) is "Was this built and founded by the right morale?". And this question concerns less about the motivation behind building a ML system than it seems.

## Background

If you have no experience or no knowledge about what a ML system is, think of it as a black box. A black box which when posed with a question outputs an answer that has a high probability of being correct. In order to get this high probability, we first need to set up the black box.<br>
In practice, we try to create many black boxes and choose the one with the highest accuracy. To build the black
