Last year (2017), I had set <a href="" target="blank">three long term goals</a>.
It focused entirely on computer science. This year, I will once again set a few goals for the year.
But, this time, I want to make sure that these are not focused only on computer science.

Goal 1:

Write at least one technical blog post each month

Why? Forces me to work on a technical project throughout the year.
Also improves my skill at writing and describing scientific and technical works.

Goal 2:

Read at least 20 books
