I am Apara. I'm a third year undergraduate student at University of Colorado, Boulder studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

My research interests include machine learning, probablity and statsitcs, and mathematical modeling. Overarchingly, I'm interested in putting these ideas together to solve problems that stem from different fields. Currently, I am working in the [Larremore Lab](http://danlarremore.com/){:target="_blank"} applying these concepts to model the underlying structure of academic resumes.

Non-academically, I am interested in music -- listening and playing. I also read a variety of books and enjoy playing a good video game once in a while.

Here's my most recent [one-page resume](/assets/pdf/AparajithanVenkateswaran.pdf){:target="_blank"}!
