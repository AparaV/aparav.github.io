title: About

I am Apara. I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at University of Colorado, Boulder studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

My research interests broadly include stochastic modeling, networks, randomized algorithms, optimization and machine learning. But really, I am more interested in developing new methods in these areas and applying them to real world problems in fields such as computer science, physics, social science and epidemiology. Currently, I am working on my honors thesis creating a model to capture the effects on node characteristics on the outcomes of interactions between them in complex networks. My advisor is [Professor Dan Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io/dan/){:target="_blank"}.

In Spring 2020, I will be TAing for [Chaotic Dynamics (CSCI 4446)](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/chaos-course.html){:target="_blank"} taught by Professor Liz Bradley.

In Summer 2019, I interned at Microsoft in Seattle. I worked in the Edge Experimentation Team developing a system to automatically identify strategies to roll out A/B tests and features to the new Edge browser. In the past, I've also worked in the [Larremore Lab](https://larremorelab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} creating statistical models to automatically discover and parse the structure of academic resumes.

Non-academically, I am interested in music -- both listening and playing. I also read a variety of books and enjoy playing a good video game once in a while. My most recent favorite fiction is _The Once and Future King_ by T.H. White -- for a children's novel (though I disagree with that), it had me thinking a long time after I finished reading it.

Here's my most recent (not one-page) [resume](/assets/pdf/AparajithanVenkateswaran.pdf){:target="_blank"}!
