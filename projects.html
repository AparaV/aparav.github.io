      				<h3>Ruins Escapade</h3>
      				<h5>Oct 2016 - Present</h5>
      				<div class="wrapper">
      					<p class="description">
      						This is a simple dungeon crawler game that I made for my Intro to Computing project. This game is written in C++ using SDL Libraries.<br>
      						Ruins Escapade is a straightforward game where the player controls the hero who is trying to find his way back home through a labryinth<br>
      						I made this game over 10 days and it currently has only one level. I am hoping to add more levels soon. If you are interested in working on the game with me, feel free to contact me.

      				<h3>Project Euler</h3>
      				<h5>Sept 2016 - Present</h5>
      				<div class="wrapper">
      					<p class="description">
      						I recently came across this amazing site with lots of computing problems - <a href="https://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a><br>
      						Since I've always been a fan of math, I began solving these mathematics problems that not only require high computing power but efficient strategies.<br>
      						I primarily code my solutions in C++ because it is a powerful and versatile language.

      				<h5>Nov 2015 - June 2016</h5>
      				<div class="wrapper">
      					<p class="description">
      						When I was in India, I started playing around with Arduino and robots. My team, consisting of 5 members, built robots as a hobby.
      						We built everything from simple wired Soccer playing robots to autonomous maze following robots to an Underwater ROV.
      						Since I moved to USA, I have not been able to work with them and my focus shifted to other interesting fields.

        					<div class="wrapper">
        						<p class="description">In this research project, I studied the Klobuchar Ionospheric Model that is used to correct GPS signals for accuracy, which would otherwise be highly erroneous</p>

        						<p class="description">
        							The organic reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid yields an ester, which is widely found in fruits.<br>
        							In this project, I studied how feasible it would be to convert alcohol (ethanol) into harmless ester by reacting it with acetic acid (vinegar) and whether it would be possible to replicate this reaction inside the human body
