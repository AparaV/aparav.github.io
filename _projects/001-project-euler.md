I recently came across this amazing site with lots of computing problems: [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/). <br>
Since I've always been a fan of math, I began solving these mathematics problems that not only require high computing power but efficient strategies. <br>
I primarily code my solutions in C++ because it is a powerful and versatile language. But you might find a bit of Python in there.
