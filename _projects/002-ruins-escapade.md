title: Ruins Escapade
number: 2
---

This is a simple dungeon crawler game that I made for my Intro to Computing project. This game is written in C++ using SDL Libraries. <Br>
Ruins Escapade is a straightforward game where the player controls the hero who is trying to find his way back home through a labyrinth. <br>
I made this game in less than a week and it currently has only one level.
I am hoping to add more levels when I get the time.

Watch a demo of the game: [Ruins Escapade - Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56loejYyuwU) <br>
