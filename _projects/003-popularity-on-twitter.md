title: Popularity on Twitter
number: 3

A program written in Python that calculates how popular a phrase is on Twitter.<br>
It collects all tweets containing the track word for 5 minutes and calculates a score based on who tweeted them and how many times it has been liked. <br>
The formula for the popularity score is a bit wibbly wobbly and still needs some work. So, it will not give you an absolutely deterministic score. <br>
This program can also analyze a user profile to see what they most commonly tweet about and how frequently they tweet.
